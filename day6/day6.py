# Functions:
# Defining a function:
def my_fun():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")


# Calling the function:
my_fun()

# Indentation: spaces vs. tabs
# In PyCharm tab creates four spaces

# While loops
while True:
    # Do some super important stuff
    print("Great")
# Or while not <condition>

# In for loop one has to specify times of performing a loop; in while loop, not
# Infinite loop: while loop that is always true
